First answer for all domain search for input_order variable selection :
Min seems to produce the best first answer with the least amount of nodes.
First answer for min domain search and all variable selection.
  best first answer : first_fail -> 41 input_order -> 42
  Number of nodes the same

All solutions 1 minute: all variable selection for indomain_min:
dom_w_deg proves instantly !
first_fail also proves but in 30 seconds
finding optimal without proving : input_order, smallest (all but largest actually)

dom_w_deg, indomain_min -> vars:
instant for makespan and only one solution, more nodes
instant before but more nodes
finds optimal without proving for e

dom_w_deg, s -> domain:
min is best, in terms of nodes
followed closely by split
all strategies prove instantly
